# Beat Mix

## Project Overview

In this project, I wrote functions to implement logic for a beat-making music machine. By the end, I created an application that can loop over a 16-step grid of four drum types and play them when they are activated. I also wrote the functionality to invert each row of drums, clear each row of drums, or clear the entire board. Finally, I built the functionality to retrieve and save presets to a server.
